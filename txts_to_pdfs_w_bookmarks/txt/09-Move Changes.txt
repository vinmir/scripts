| Pokémon Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2 Redux        |
| Move Changes (v1.2.1)                               |
o-----------------------------------------------------o

=========================================================
General Changes
=========================================================
The attributes of all moves (power, accuracy, PP, effect chance, priority) are updated to match Sword and Shield, with both DLCs.
 - Charm and Moonlight are now Fairy-type as in Sword and Shield.

Legends: Arceus and 'Dexit' have introduced a high degree of fragmentation towards move effects in the main series.
 - See 'Redux Move Modifications' below for more information on how we've tackled that!


=========================================================
Move Replacements
=========================================================
To help modernise the game, the following moves have been replaced with moves from later generations.
 - Moves under the "Old Move" column are now unavailable.

Redux Move Modifications
=========================================================
As of late, the Pokémon series has become decently fragmented across different titles when it comes to moves. 
 - With Legends: Arceus came a further fragmentation of move effects across the Pokémon series. 
 - As of writing, it's hard to know what will carry over to the 'mainline' series (think Stealth Rock changes etc).
 - This makes updating moves to current standards fairly tricky, so we've gone with a 'selective' approach - e.g. just take the bits we like!

Below are all the changes made to moves from vanilla Gen V in Redux. There are three different categories of changes:
 - Changes made by Gamefreak in the mainline series of games (XY -> Sword and Shield). These changes are unmarked.
 - Changes made by Gamefreak in Legends: Arceus. These changes are marked by an '[L:A]'.
 - Changes made by ourselves, like in Renegade Platinum, are marked by an '[!]'.

Further Modifications
 - All Sound Moves now hit through a defenders Substitute, like in Gen VI+.

*Not currently implemented/cannot be properly implemented due limitations with the Gen V engine/toolset. 
**Accounting for the x2 damage of critical hits in Gen V, as opposed to the x1.5 damage of Gen VI+.
***Born of current Gen V Limitations, uses Triple Kick mechanics, with a higher initial base power. This should work out to roughly the same amount of damage.
