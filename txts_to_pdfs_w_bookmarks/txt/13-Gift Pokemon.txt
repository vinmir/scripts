General Notes
=========================================================

All Pokémon here have the normal chance to be shiny. There are no shiny locks.
 - Thus, you can soft reset for shinies. 
 - The Starter Gifts do not show if the Pokémon is shiny in the little picture. This cannot be implemented sadly!
